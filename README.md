## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Supported Log Formats

LogSentinel automatically detects and parses:

- **Web Server Logs**: Apache, Nginx, IIS access logs
- **System Logs**: Syslog, systemd journal, Windows Event logs
- **Security Logs**: Firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, authentication logs
- **Application Logs**: Custom application logs with timestamps
- **Cloud Logs**: AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity logs, GCP audit logs

### Pattern Recognition Engine

The backend includes advanced regex patterns for:

- **Attack Vectors**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, path traversal, command injection
- **Reconnaissance**: Port scanning, directory enumeration, vulnerability scanning  
- **Authentication Attacks**: Brute force, credential stuffing, privilege escalation
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unusual download patterns, large file transfers
- **Malware Indicators**: C&C communication, suspicious user agents

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Threat Patterns

Extend the threat detection by modifying `backend_utils.py`:

```python
# Add custom attack patterns
custom_patterns = {
    'Custom Attack': r'your_regex_pattern_here',
    'Business Logic Bypass': r'price=0|quantity=-\d+',
    'API Abuse': r'api.*rate.*limit|api.*quota.*exceeded'
}
```

### Performance Tuning

For large log files (>1GB):
- Use streaming analysis mode
- Implement sampling for initial assessment
- Consider log preprocessing and filtering

### Integration Options

LogSentinel can be integrated with:
- **SIEM Systems**: Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: MISP, ThreatConnect

- Log data remains on your system
- Encrypted storage options available
- Secure deletion of temporary files

### Operational Security
- Use appropriate file permissions (600/640 for log files)
- Implement log rotation and archival policies  
- Consider data classification and retention requirements
- Validate log integrity before analysis

### Compliance Support
- **GDPR**: Data minimization and privacy by design
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection standards
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security requirements
- **SOX**: Financial reporting compliance

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Issues with Large Files**:
```bash
# Increase Python memory limit
export PYTHONHASHSEED=0
ulimit -v 8388608  # 8GB virtual memory limit
```

**tkinter Not Available (Linux)**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# CentOS/RHEL  
sudo yum install tkinter

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tk
```

**Permission Denied Errors**:
```bash
# Fix file permissions
chmod +x logsentinel.py run.sh
chmod 644 *.py requirements.txt
```

**Performance Optimization**:
- For files >100MB, consider pre-filtering logs
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance
- Increase system RAM for large dataset analysis

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
export LOGSENTINEL_DEBUG=1
python3 logsentinel.py
```
